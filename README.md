# Java DNS Server

## Overview

This project is a lightweight Domain Name System (DNS) server written in Java. It responds to DNS queries using data from a custom-formatted zone file and supports A and NS record types. The server operates over UDP and includes a basic DNS cache with TTL expiration support.

The project demonstrates key networking concepts such as socket programming, binary protocol parsing, and DNS message handling.

## Features

- UDP-based DNS query handling (standard port 53)
- Parses A and NS records from a zone file
- Caches DNS responses with TTL enforcement
- Builds and parses DNS messages to conform with protocol format
- Modular design with separate classes for zone handling, messages, caching, and the server core

> üìù Note: The example zone file (`csci3363.zone`) used during development is **excluded** from this repository to avoid publishing coursework-provided materials. You can supply your own zone file in a compatible format (see below).

## Zone File Format

To test this DNS server, you will need to create a zone file with records in the following format:

```
example.com A 1.2.3.4 60
example.com NS ns1.example.com 60
```

- **Format**: `<domain> <type> <value> <ttl>`
- **Supported types**: `A`, `NS`
- **TTL**: Time to live, in seconds

Save this file as `yourdomain.zone` and reference it when running the server.

## How to Compile and Run

### Compile

```bash
make
```

### Run the Server

```bash
java dns.DNSServer <port> <zone-file>
```

Example:
```bash
java dns.DNSServer 8053 yourdomain.zone
```

### Test with `dig`

You can test it using the `dig` command:

```bash
dig @localhost -p 8053 example.com
```

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Socket programming with UDP
- DNS protocol parsing and construction
- Caching logic and TTL expiration
- File parsing and validation
- Binary message handling with Java byte arrays
